<h2>{{page.title}}</h2>

You can’t change your entire life.

You can only change your next action.

--

You can’t change a relationship with a loved one.

You can only change your next interaction.

--

You can’t change your entire job.

You can only change your next task.

--

You can’t change your body composition.

You can only change your next meal.

--

You can’t change your fitness level.

You can only start moving.

--

You can’t declutter your entire life.

You can only choose to get rid of one thing, right now.

--

You can’t eliminate your entire debt.

You can only make one payment, or buy one less unnecessary item.

--

You can’t change the past, or control the future.

You can only change what you’re doing right now.

--

You can’t change everything.

You can only change one, small thing.

And that’s all it takes.
